# Lexi-Q Project

**In this project I've created a word guessing game similar to 'Wordle' using nearly all information
that is taught in YZV104 course. I've spent so much time on it, I really tried to make it flawless as much as 
I can, but sometimes you may encounter some problems. This is the nature of the programing I guess. 
Thanks for your time and Have Fun!!!**

## Game Modes

Lexi-Q offers three different game modes:

- 5-Lettered Mode: Guess a word with five letters.

**( All wordlists are created using web-scrapping methods )**
